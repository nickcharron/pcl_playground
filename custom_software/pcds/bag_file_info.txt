Information on the bag files that are recorded and saved for calibration:

Bag 1. 01-26_17:45: Scan of under the counter in the lab with objects blocking much
                of the space for that there are clear surfaces to optimize against
                and most measurements are close range so less error. Did back and
                forth rotation

Bag 2. 01-26_17:46: Same as last, but better quality scan I think

Bag 3. 01-26_17:57: Scan of the whole SDIC lab. Did full 360 degree rotation (pitch)
                    in place in front of Dylan's desk
